description: To reduce your react native application size for android, we'll need to configure the build file to generate a compressed bundle for your react native app and then split it into multiple bundles for all architectures so that it can be made more lightweight.

So you made a cool and awesome looking [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) app, and now you‚Äôre ready to build it and maybe publish it to the store ‚Äî

But worried about it if the users would want to install it given its build size? Or maybe you just want to keep it lightweight and not take too much memory unnecessarily when it can be packed into a smaller size?

Or you‚Äôre just one of us who are paranoid about build sizes? Don‚Äôt worry, we got you covered! üòÑ ‚úîÔ∏è

<hr />

In this article, we will cover the following two things:

- Compress the react native application size - by compressing the java bytecode that is generated while building our app and also asking it to try and shrink all the resources that are bundled with the application.

- Splitting our application bundle into multiple APKs to remove unnecessary code which is not required by the device which is going to run it - because a lot of code is bundled with the universal APK that is device-specific - meaning that we don't need a lot of code in the device we're going to install it in.

Let's get started! ‚úä

First of all, you‚Äôll need to eject your native app if you‚Äôre using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) for your project ( You might have already done this if you‚Äôve built your application before reading this article ). This is important since you don‚Äôt have access to configurations until you eject, as the build folder is where we have to make changes. If you haven‚Äôt, you can simply do this by :

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note :** Ejecting a react native application is a permanent action! ( Unless you‚Äôre using a version control system to keep track of previous versions of your app ‚Äî from where you can recover the ‚Äòunejected‚Äô version of your app later if you need ). [Learn more about ejecting.](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/EJECTING.md")

Okay, so now we‚Äôre all set! Let‚Äôs get started and get that done fast. Don‚Äôt worry, it just takes a few minutes, and your app size will shrink dramatically!

Now, navigate to the `android/app` folder from your project root directory where you can find your `build.gradle` file.

![post](./rrnas-1.png)

Here, you‚Äôll find your default build configurations already set up, find the line which looks like this :

```groovy
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = false
def enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture = false
```

and change their value to `true` like this :

```groovy
def enableProguardInReleaseBuilds = true
def enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture = true
```

So you might be wondering what it does. Well, if you scroll down a bit you‚Äôll see `enableProguardInReleaseBuilds` and `enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture` written at a few more places like here:

![post](./rrnas-2.png)

As you can see, these variables are being used to enable or disable two build configurations ‚Äî

- One for generating separate .apks for different device architectures,

```groovy
...
splits {
 abi {
 reset()
 enable enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture
...
```

_Don't worry about having to handle different .apks for each architecture ‚Äî Google takes care of distributing it to the users! And separating the builds according to architecture removes unnecessary code from your file which is not required on the device it is running._

- Another one for compressing the Java bytecode generated while building, as in,

```groovy
...
buildTypes {
 release {
 minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
...
```

Phew, that was pretty easy! But wait, we‚Äôre not done yet! There‚Äôs one little thing we need to do.

Now let‚Äôs add this line right below the `minifyEnabled` configuration :

```groovy
...
buildTypes {
 release {
 minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
 shrinkResources true; /* <-- Add this line */
...
```

And we‚Äôre done! Now build your app again and check the `output` directory. You‚Äôll find two different APKs of your app, which is specified in the configuration by default, i.e., for `armebi` and `x86` architectures.

Oh, and by the way, if you need a universal APK that supports all device architectures ‚Äî just set `universalApk` to true, and it‚Äôll generate a universal APK next time you run build!

That‚Äôs all! Now you‚Äôve set up your build configuration to shrink your code along with resources and create separate APK for different architectures ‚Äî thus removing unnecessary code from the final build.
