# Architecting React Applications - What I learned from my experience as a Web developer


<br />

React has always been popular for its short learning curve and easy to use APIs. But if you have been working with this popular javascript library for a while now, you might agree with me on this one as well -- If you don't pay attention to it's structure it will soon become an unmaintainable mess. 

Before joining my first job, I had some experience as a freelancer but didn't know much about best practices and architecture apart from what I had come across either online or while development. And even as a freelancer I didn't have experience with such large scale applications that we had to work with later in the job. That is when I started paying more attention to architecture. In the start, things used to get a little confusing sometimes - mostly because I was a bit more conscious about my code than before - which was obvious as I was part of a team now and not a solo freelancer.

So I started looking through GitHub, online articles, papers and books. And as I kept working with React more and more on a large scale I had realised that

This applies to any application or software but with React, abstraction was a bit more difficult than other libraries / frameworks. This was until Hooks were introduced - but we will keep it out of the context for now as it is still fairly new and most of the applications are still built with older versions of React. Also, there are a lot of improvements to be made; lot of do's and dont's to be discovered with its usage. 

As of now, I think the principle that I follow for structuring React applications will work fairly well with Hooks too! Since the focus was on a scalable web application architecture - not just React.
