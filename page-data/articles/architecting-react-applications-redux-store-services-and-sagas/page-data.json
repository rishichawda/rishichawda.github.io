All the actions go into a directory called <code>actions</code>, reducers in their directory, and the same for middlewares. One thing that is not very common here is a <code>root.reducer</code> and <code>root.store</code> file at the <code>src</code> root. Now, many developers I have known to prefer keeping the <code>root.reducer</code> ( sometimes stored as an <code>index.js</code> ) inside the <code>reducers</code> directory because it is then ‚Äòcloser‚Äô to all the reducers. I agree it might make much sense to keep it that way, but I prefer keeping my <code>root.reducer</code> and <code>root.store</code> in the root of my <code>src</code>. And here‚Äôs why :</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>reducers</code> directory is strictly kept for storing individual reducers. The <code>index.js</code> inside it is used as the main entry point to export all the reducers. ‚òùÔ∏è</li>\n<li><code>root.reducer</code> and <code>root.store</code> seem <em>closer</em> ( or hooked? ) rather than all the reducers closer to the <code>root.reducer</code> ‚Äî since <code>root.reducer</code> here is being used to configure the reducer before we hook it up with store ( which is done inside <code>root.store</code> later ).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it pretty much makes sense ‚Äî to keep all the reducers separately in a place and then just imported through a single entry point to our <code>root.reducer</code>, which stays close to our <code>root.store</code>. The simple reason is it is easier to find at the root of <code>src</code> directory than inside another nested directory. That is one of the reasons why it is named <code>root.reducer</code> and not <code>index.js</code>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, our <code>actions</code> directory contains all our <code>actions</code>, an <code>action.types</code> file for all the action types <em>( we can even have a directory named <code>shared</code> in the <code>src</code> and put the type file there, I used to do it when I had started using redux )</em> and the main entry file which exports all the actions. Each file inside our <code>actions</code> directory can contain a set of actions that are related to a single aspect of our application, for example, a user, or a user interface state or perhaps some data synchronization. The same goes for the <code>middlewares</code> directory, which holds our custom middlewares, if any, and a single entry point which exports all of them.</p>\n<p>Note that all three new directories added to our previous structure have the main entry point, which exports all the individual parts ‚Äî mainly because it makes the imports cleaner and also makes it look modular.</p>\n<p>So, we‚Äôre done with the basic stuff that could be added to any react application which implements an application state ( A little secret ‚Äî you can do it without using redux too! ). ü§ì</p>\n<br />\n<h3>Let‚Äôs add some more stuff.</h3>\n<p>Let‚Äôs add more volume to the codebase. The first thing that comes to my mind is sagas ‚Äî mainly because any real-world application with a considerable codebase usually has asynchronous actions going on in parallel. Let‚Äôs assume we need <a href=\"https://redux-saga.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">redux-saga</a> for our application, and we can‚Äôt do away with thunks!</p>\n<p>Oh wait, let‚Äôs have some services too ‚Äî for fun! üí•</p>\n<p>And while we‚Äôre at it ‚Äî let‚Äôs not forget about making our state management which we had set up earlier a little better by adding selectors to our application ‚Äî which is a must by the way if we have many things going on inside our application store!</p>\n<p>Did I add too much? Well, to cover all of it, without implying that your application can not have all of it, which can pretty much if required.</p>\n<p>Okay, let‚Äôs follow the same pattern and make the directories first. I‚Äôll go ahead and create directories for them, like so :</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 589px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/27a7d9295cf8efe158bde0da50d0e3f6/b1665/directory-structure-2.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 52.1875%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"source-directory\"\n        title=\"source-directory\"\n        src=\"/static/27a7d9295cf8efe158bde0da50d0e3f6/b1665/directory-structure-2.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/27a7d9295cf8efe158bde0da50d0e3f6/72799/directory-structure-2.png 320w,\n/static/27a7d9295cf8efe158bde0da50d0e3f6/b1665/directory-structure-2.png 589w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>This structure might look pretty much self-explanatory, and you already have an idea of how we might structure them internally. All our sagas go inside the <code>sagas</code> directory, with our root saga also inside it <em>( you can name it whatever you want ‚Äî <code>root.saga</code> or <code>index.js</code> )</em> just like our entry points to reducers and actions inside their directories.</p>\n<p>But you might ask, why not keep it outside like our <code>root.reducer</code> and <code>root.store</code>? ü§î</p>\n<p>Well, here‚Äôs a pretty simple explanation. When we discussed about the reducers and actions, we kept the entry point of the directory as something we‚Äôre directly using in our application ‚Äî entry point in <code>reducers</code> directory for importing all reducers to <code>root.reducer</code> and entry point in <code>actions</code> directory for importing them in various parts of our react application. Similarly, for our <code>root.saga</code> or <code>index.js</code> inside the <code>sagas</code> directory, which is going to be used in our <code>root.store</code> while initialization, makes more sense to be seen as an entry/access point and not anything more complicated than that. Usually, it‚Äôll contain our root saga, which spawns/calls/forks/ invoke other sagas accordingly.</p>\n<p>The same goes for selectors and services. Both contain an entry point that exports all the selectors and service modules from the directory. Keep in mind that it is there to provide us a cleaner import and better view of the structure!</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>And there we go! We have pretty much completed setting up our react application to start with a complicated project ‚Äî but with a relatively simple structure which anyone can get used to and something that scales well too! In my experience, a similar structure has fared well in scaling up along with regular and extensive application-wide changes while keeping our productivity high.</p>\n<br/>\n<p><em>Did you like this article?
